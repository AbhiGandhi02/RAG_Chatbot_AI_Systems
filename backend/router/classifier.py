"""
Query Classifier (Model Router) — Deterministic, rule-based query classification.

Classifies queries as "simple" or "complex" using explicit rules based on:
- Query length (word count)
- Presence of complexity-indicating keywords
- Number of question marks (multi-part questions)
- Greeting/farewell patterns
- Complaint/urgency indicators

Routes:
  simple  → llama-3.1-8b-instant
  complex → llama-3.3-70b-versatile
